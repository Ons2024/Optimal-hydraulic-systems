# Optimal Hydraulic Systems - Valve Condition Prediction

This project is a web application for predicting the condition of a hydraulic system valve using sensor data and machine learning. It provides a user-friendly interface to input a cycle ID and receive a prediction about the valve's state, along with the model's confidence and the ground truth for comparison.
